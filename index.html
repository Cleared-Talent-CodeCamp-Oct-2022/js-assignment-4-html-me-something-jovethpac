   <title>Royal Family European Vacation 2022</title>

  <h1>Joveth’s Royal Family Vacation 2022</h1> 
   <p>Hello and thank you for looking at my first website. No, I’m not actually a royal -more like a pauper- but my family and I did go on a European cruise a few months ago aboard the Odyssey of the Seas by <a href ="https://www.royalcaribbean.com/cruise-ships/odyssey-of-the-seas">Royal Caribbean</a>. Below are highlights and “lowlights” of our much deserved trip that was cancelled twice due to the pandemic.

<h4>Highlights of our trip</h4> 
<dl>
   <dt id="Beginning of Cruise">Rome/Civitavecchia:</dt>
   <img width="1000" height="667" src="Rome.jpg" alt="Family Picture at the Colosseum"/><figcaption>Oops, we forgot to take the little one's mask of.</figcaption>
   <dd>Spent a couple of days here before boarding our cruise ship. It was the girl's first time and they enjoyed pasta and gelatos galore.
      Got what I thought was a great family pic and then you see poor Emily with her mask still on. When we look back, I guess you could say that this was taken during COVID times.
   </dd>

<p id="Naples"><img width="1000" height="667" src="Naples.jpg" alt="Large Plaza in Pompeii"/><figcaption>Pompeii is huge and was full of tourits even in September.</figcaption>Naples:My youngest daughter, Emily, became obsessed with Medusa during a day trip to Pompeii and it was a great opportunity to teach her a little about Greek mythology (my inner nerd is smiling). On our first excursion, my daughters also learned that the penis was a sign of good luck.
   
</p>
<p id="First day at sea"> Cruising: Husband and Twin niece one suffered a good bout of Staphylococcus aureus after eating fruit salad. They promptly threw it up, felt better continued as usual with their evening.

</p>
<p id="Thira/Santorini"><img width="1000" height="667" src="Santorini.jpg" alt="On top of the hill"/><figcaption>Resting with a good book after so much walking.</figcaption> Thira/Santorini: Soo many freaking hills! Pretty but I did not want to exercise that day.
   Got held up as we were about to disembark. Jason was denied disembarkation so we had to go to the medical center and tell them that the previous night’s vomiting was from food poisoning and not COVID.
 </p> 
<p id="Athens/Piraeus"><img width="1000" height="667" src="Athens.jpg" alt="Emily in the shadows"/><figcaption>Bad photo taken be a fellow tourist.</figcaption><img width="1000" height="667" src="Athens2.jpg" alt="Entire family is shown this time"/><figcaption>Much better photo taken by a different tourist.</figcaption> Athens/Piraeus: Soo many hills again! The trek up to the Parthenon was a tough one. One tourist was even laid out on the ground and was being fanned and protected by the sun by her family. Poor Emily does not have any luck when it comes to family pictures. You can barely see her in the shadow. Luckily, we have a backup picture with the Parthenon, currently under renovation, in the background.

</p>
<p id="Mykonos">Mykonos: Another very pretty city with white buildings. Quite a windy excursion where we learned that Greece is littered with cats .The girls highlight of the trip was not of the sights but of petting the felines everywhere.

</p>
<p id="Kusadasi"><img width="1000" height="667" src="Ephesus_Library.jpg"/><figcaption>In front of the Ephesus Library</figcaption>Kusadasi: the highlight of a site with beautiful Roman ruins.<img width="1000" height="667" src="Magic_Carpet.jpg"/><figcaption>The salesman fed us and did a demonstration first before selling the carpets.</figcaption>Got taken on a magic carpet ride. The salesmen were so pushy that I ended up purchasing almost 10,000 USD [9481.50 &euro; or 8158.27 &pound;] worth of carpet! Ugggghhh.  Were they overpriced? Yes. Were they worth it? No.  Do I regret them? Absolutely, because I had just quit my job and was about to embark on a 5 month coding journey unpaid! But do they look great in my dining room and kitchen? Yes, because they’re so colorful and they’re handmade.

</p>
<p id="Chania/Crete">Chania/Crete: We sat this excursion out and spend the day on board. Walking around the ship and sleeping. While cruises are a ton of fun, they are also very tiring because you don't want to miss out on any activities. We usually have a major case of FOMO when we're on a cruise because we spent so much time planning and anticipating it

</p>
<p id="Second day at sea"><img width="1000" height="667" src="AppreciatingCrew.jpg" alt="Dining Crew"><figcaption>Showering the crew with cheers and applauses.</figcaption> Cruising: We had our last fabulous meal and we showed our appreciation to the hardworking dining crew. They came out and danced and we cheered and applauded them. There is non stop food on a cruise but the best past is our nightly 1.5 to 2-hour meals each and every night with family.

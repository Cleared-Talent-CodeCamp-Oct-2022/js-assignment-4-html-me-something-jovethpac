   <h1>Joveth’s Royal Family Vacation 2022</h1>
   <p>Hello and thank you for looking at my first website. No, I’m not actually a royal -more like a pauper- but my
      family and I did go on a European cruise a few months ago aboard the Odyssey of the Seas by <a
         href="https://www.royalcaribbean.com/cruise-ships/odyssey-of-the-seas">Royal Caribbean</a>. Below are
      highlights and “lowlights” of our much deserved trip that was cancelled twice due to the pandemic.

   <h4>Highlights of our trip</h4>
   <dl>
      <dt id="Beginning of Cruise">Day 1: Rome/Civitavecchia, Italy:</dt>
      <dd>Spent a couple of days here before boarding our cruise ship. It was the girl's first time and they enjoyed
         pasta and gelatos galore.
         Got what I thought was a great family pic and then you see poor Emily with her mask still on. When we look
         back, I guess you could say that this was taken during COVID times.

   <p id="Naples">Day 2: Naples, Italy:
      <br> My youngest daughter, Emily, became obsessed with Medusa during a day trip to Pompeii and it was a great
      opportunity to teach her a little about Greek mythology (my inner nerd is smiling). On our first excursion, my
      daughters also learned that the penis was a sign of good luck.

   <p id="First day at sea">Day 3: Cruising:<br>Husband and Twin niece one suffered a good bout of Staphylococcus aureus
      after eating fruit salad. They promptly threw it up, felt better and continued immediately as usual with their
      evening.
   </p>
   <p id="Thira/Santorini">Day 4: Thira/Santorini, Greece:<br>Soo many hills! Pretty but I did not want to exercise that
      day. Got held up as we were about to disembark. Jason was denied disembarkation so we had to go to the medical
      center and tell them that the previous night’s vomiting was from food poisoning and not COVID.

   <p id="Athens/Piraeus">Day 5: Athens/Piraeus, Greece:<br>Soo many hills again! The trek up to the Parthenon was a
      tough one.
      One
      tourist was even laid out on the ground and was being fanned and protected by the sun by her family. Poor Emily
      does not have any luck when it comes to family pictures. You can barely see her in the shadow. Luckily, we have a
      backup picture with the Parthenon, currently under renovation, in the background.

   </p>
   <p id="Mykonos">Day 6: Mykonos, Greece:<br>Another very pretty city with white buildings. Quite a windy excursion
      where we
      learned that Greece is littered with cats .The girls highlight of the trip was not of the sights but of petting
      the felines everywhere.
   </p>
   <p id="Kusadasi">Day 7: Kusadasi, Turkey:<br>the highlight of a site with beautiful Roman ruins. Got taken on a magic
      carpet
      ride. The salesmen were so pushy that I ended up purchasing almost 10,000 USD [9481.50 &euro; or 8158.27 &pound;]
      worth of carpet! Ugggghhh. Were they overpriced? Yes. Were they worth it? No. Do I regret them? Absolutely,
      because I had just quit my job and was about to embark on a 5 month coding journey unpaid! But do they look great
      in my dining room and kitchen? Yes, because they’re so colorful and they’re handmade.

   </p>
   <p id="Chania/Crete">Day 8:<br>Chania/Crete, Greece: We sat this excursion out and spend the day on board. Walking
      around the
      ship and sleeping. While cruises are a ton of fun, they are also very tiring because you don't want to miss out on
      any activities. We usually have a major case of FOMO when we're on a cruise because we spent so much time planning
      and anticipating it
   </p>
   <p id="Second day at sea">Day 9:<br>Cruising: We had our last fabulous meal and we showed our appreciation to the
      hardworking dining crew. They came out and danced and we cheered and applauded them. There is non stop food on a
      cruise but the best past is our nightly 1.5 to 2-hour meals each and every night with <br>

      <dt id="End of Cruise">Day 10:<br>Rome/Civitavecchi, Italy:</dt>
      <dd>Spent the last few days here doing the tourist thing again. Rome is such a beautiful city and we look forward
         to returning.</dd>
